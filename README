Demonstration of a box2d bug (or self caused error) I expierence.

What I do:
I connect a dynamic body with a static body to 'pin' it to a fixed position.
I set up a pivot point to alter the rotation point of the dynamic body.
I rotate the dynamic body by applying a torque to it.

What happens:
After some time spend applying torques to the body, the body will move away from
the pivot point of the joint.

What I expected to happen:
The dynamic should stay at the pivot point and only move for rotation purposes.
So that in the Debugdraw the localAnchor would always be drawn ontop of the pivot point.



Code:
see file: src/Application.js -> function: createMinimalFailCase
